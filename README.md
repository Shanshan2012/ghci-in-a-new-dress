# Dependencies

* Yesod

* Hoogle (/Users/abi/Library/Haskell/ghc-7.0.3/lib/hoogle-4.2.8/bin) â€” The Hoogle executable ought to be in the path but not just in .bashrc but also, symlinked in /usr/bin/. Probably because createProcess runs sh, rather than bash? Or createProcess only looks in /usr/bin.

This should be a .cabal file.
